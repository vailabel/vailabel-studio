## üìù Code Standards & Guidelines

### Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive branch names following this pattern:

```bash
# Feature branches
feature/add-user-authentication
feature/implement-ai-labeling

# Bug fixes
fix/resolve-login-issue
fix/correct-annotation-display

# Documentation
docs/update-api-guide
docs/add-setup-instructions

# Refactoring
refactor/optimize-performance
refactor/restructure-components
```

### Commit Message Format

Follow conventional commit format across all modules:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
